This script forces first-person camera view while aiming to create a more realistic gameplay experience in FiveM.

When a player aims on foot, the camera automatically switches to first person and returns to third person when they stop aiming.
Optional vehicle support allows the same behavior while aiming in cars, bikes, and boats, with separate handling for each vehicle type.
